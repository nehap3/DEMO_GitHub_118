This is the feature1 branch in the DEMO_GitHub_118 repository.
This file (feature1.txt) was created as part of my first DevOps practical.
I am learning how to work with branches in Git and GitHub.
Branches help in managing different features separately without affecting the main branch.
Once the work is completed, the feature branch can be merged into the main branch.
This practice improves version control and collaborative development.
