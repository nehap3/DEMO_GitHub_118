~~~ Working with Git and GitHub ~~~
This repository is part of my first DevOps practical, "Working with Git and GitHub." It covers fundamental Git operations like cloning, committing, pushing, and branching. Through this, I am learning version control, repository management, and collaboration using GitHub. This hands-on practice helps in understanding how developers track changes and work efficiently in teams.
